## ðŸ“¡ Network Security Threat Detection using Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project for detecting network security threats. This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of building, evaluating, and deploying a machine learning model for anomaly detection in network traffic â€” incorporating MLOps best practices and cloud deployment pipelines.

Part of the Complete Data Science, Machine Learning, DL & NLP Bootcamp by Krish Naik.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project aims to address one of the most critical challenges in cybersecurity â€” detecting threats in real time. Using supervised machine learning techniques and a structured ML pipeline, the project includes:

Data cleaning & preprocessing of network logs

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & feature engineering

Model training & evaluation using ML algorithms

Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization

Deployment-ready pipeline using Docker, MLFlow, and cloud platforms (AWS/Azure)

MLOps practices to streamline experimentation and deployment

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools Used

Programming Language: Python

Frameworks & Libraries:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn

MLFlow

BentoML

Flask & Streamlit

Deployment & DevOps:
